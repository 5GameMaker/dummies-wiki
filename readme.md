Documenting what isn't!
</center>

"For Dummies!" is a collection of writeups for me to use personally.

For building the website, do `$ cargo run`.
Resulting webroot will be located at `target/web`.

Use whatever web server you like, i.e. `python -m http.server`.

Webroot can be specified as an extra argument `$ cargo run [path]`.
