# Wiki article structure

Wiki is stored in markdown format.

All articles start with the header that is then used as the page's title, following
a short description.

## Routing documents

If a document is meant to be an intermediate for its subdocuments (usually `readme.md`),
at the end it has a `## Contents` section with a list of wikilinks pointing to the
other markdown documents without the extension.
